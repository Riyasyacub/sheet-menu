# README

This project is solely developed by me (Riyas Yacub). This is one of my hobby project which is **not yet completed**.

### PROBLEM

Restaurants face the following problems:

1. Misunderstanding a menu item for other while taking orders
2. Unsure of the availability of a menu item
3. Frequently changing the price of the menu items
4. Special occasion items cannot be added to the existing menu card

### SOLUTION

To resolve the above problems, I came up with the following solution.

Restaurant owners after signing up to my website they will sync their menu card in the form of SpreadSheet. 
I will create or update the menu card items. This can be done at any point of time.
Owners can update the number of tables too. So that I will create Unique QR codes for each table.
Customers can scan the QR code and order the food without the intervention of waiters.

All the above features are updated on real time

### TECHNOLOGIES USED

1. Ruby on Rails 7
2. Tailwind CSS
3. Hotwire
4. Stimulus JS
5. JQuery
6. Postgres
